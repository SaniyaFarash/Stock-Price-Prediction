# Stock-Price-Prediction
In this project, I developed an artificial neural network using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to predict the closing stock price of Apple Inc. The model was trained using the past 60 days' stock prices, obtained from Yahoo Finance, from January 2012 to January 2023. The data was preprocessed and scaled using MinMaxScaler to ensure the input features were within a suitable range for the model. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was calculated to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.
